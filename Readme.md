T(ic) T(ac) T(oe) CLI
=====================

This is a command line interface to my [Java TTT lib](https://github.com/JoshCheek/java-ttt-library). I created it as a practice assignment during my residency at [8th Light](http://www.8thlight.com/). I'm pretty happy with it, it's at least the third time I've written this thing, and this is the first time I've really felt satisfied with my testing.
